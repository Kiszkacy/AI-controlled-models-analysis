## AI-controlled models analysis
Welcome to the AI-controlled Models Analysis project repository! This project serves as a Bachelor's final project aimed at analyzing behaviors in AI-controlled models within a virtual environment.

## Project overview
The main goal of this project is to create an application capable of simulating a dynamic environment, allowing observation and analysis of behaviors and interactions among virtual creatures (agents). Each agent is controlled by its own neural network. Through the analysis of this simulation, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of artificial intelligence and its impact on agent behaviors under various conditions.

Users will have the ability to create and configure parameters and features of autonomous agents and the environment. Additionally, they can control the simulation process and analyze data and statistics using visualization tools for numerical and qualitative data. The environment will serve both for training neural networks and for running pre-trained models and visualizing behaviors.

## Project structure and documentation
This repository consists of two main parts:

* Core Module - contains the code responsible for training the agents.
* Engine - implements the graphical user interface and simulation environment.

For detailed information on each part and how to set up and use the project, please refer to the corresponding sections in our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Kiszkacy/AI-controlled-models-analysis/wiki).
